# [Ask a flowchart: What Should I Use the Crispr Gene editing Tool to Build?](http://reye.sh/Ask-a-flowchart-What-Should-I-Use-the-Crispr-Gene-editing-Tool-to-Build-/)
This is the same code that was used in [Ask a flowchart: Should I quit my tech job?](https://github.com/reyesh/Ask-a-flowchart-should-i-quit-my-tech-job-) 

This demo was created to show that my flowchart web app is scalable. The actually github code from branch "gh-pages" is live at [http://reye.sh/Ask-a-flowchart-What-Should-I-Use-the-Crispr-Gene-editing-Tool-to-Build-/](http://reye.sh/Ask-a-flowchart-What-Should-I-Use-the-Crispr-Gene-editing-Tool-to-Build-/)
